 <p>Founder and counselor, Melissa Houser began Sparkle Counseling in 2011, after five years of counseling at-risk individuals suffering from adjustment difficulties, severe traumas, attachment issues, and dual diagnoses. Although her experience equips her to counsel an array of issues of varying severity, her heart&rsquo;s special passion is working with teens, young adult women, and children.</p>

<p>
Melissa integrates experiential modalities such as sand trays, art, play, and music with traditional talk-therapy approaches of Cognitive-Behavioral therapy, Motivational Interviewing, and insight-oriented approaches.<br /><br /> 
Her goal is to weave these approaches together to work with an individual&rsquo;s strengths, empowering them with a new self-story. She says, &ldquo;I believe everyone has strengths that allow success, but sometimes they are forgotten due to trauma or abuse. A fresh perspective can put the whole story together, provide that reminder, and allow an individual to emerge-spark of life reignited.&rdquo;
